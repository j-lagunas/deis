Scale Manually
``````````````
To add nodes manually without using the Deis :ref:`Provider` API,
use the ``deis nodes:create`` command to bootstrap the nodes over SSH.
Nodes must be added by their hostname and placed into a target layer.
Deis will use the layer's SSH configuration to bootstrap the node.

.. code-block:: console

    $ deis nodes:create dev node1.example.com --layer=runtime
    Creating node for node1.example.com... done in 107s
