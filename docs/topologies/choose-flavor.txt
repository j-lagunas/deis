Choose a Flavor
```````````````
When creating :ref:`Layers <layer>` you must provide a node :ref:`flavor`, 
which specifies basic server configuration.
If deploying a formation manually without help from 
the Deis :ref:`Provider` API, use the "static" flavor.
We will use the "ec2-us-west-2" flavor which benefits from 
automated provisioning via the EC2 Provider API.
