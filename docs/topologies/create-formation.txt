Create the Formation
--------------------
Let's create a formation that can host
:ref:`Applications <application>` and :ref:`Containers <container>` 
for developers -- we'll call it the "dev" formation.

.. code-block:: console

    $ deis formations:create dev --domain=deisapp.com
    Creating formation... done, created dev  
    
    See `deis help layers:create` to begin building your formation
