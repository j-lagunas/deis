Configure Wildcard DNS
----------------------
In order to expose applications to end-users, you must configure DNS to route
inbound requests to the formation's proxy layer.
This needs to be done using wildcard DNS so that \*.formation.domain resolves
to the proxy nodes.

How you accomplish this depends in large part on your DNS provider.
At the end of the process, you should be able to query "testing123.deisapp.com"
(where deisapp.com is replaced with your formation's domain)
and have it return the A records for your proxy nodes.
